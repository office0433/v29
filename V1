Basically my plan is that to run one playbook and gather enough data to size up later. The problem is that I dont get enough reps on range extreme trades. May be 2-3 month max.
I dont want to sit and do nothing all that time. Since the main setup I am playing is that reversion. Instead of just taking the reversion trades at Range extremes to
other side of the range extreme while taking partials out at FTA or Mid range. So the execution or trigger for this is based on AECI concept using AGGR/ Footprint and other orderfloww
tools. 
So I am thinking instead of just taking range extreme trades few times a month why cant I take same reversion trades ewhich are again based on AEIC conceptt but the context
I am using are Weekly SD3 or Daily VWAP SD3. In this case, i will takeing profit at weekly or daily vwap . 

Days when I am at home and locked in I could take trades on daily VWAP reversion to mean on lkower timeframe which would give me some more reps to practice taking trades and
identifying AEIC. 

So I can take same reversion trades at range extremes, Weekly SD3 and Daily SD3 each with different fixed risk profile and profit taking strategy. 

Do you think this would still align with my yearly goals and help me pass competent stage
